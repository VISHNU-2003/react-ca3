// This is a JavaScript file that defines a `Main` component for a React application. Here's a breakdown of the code:

// - The first line imports the `React` package, which is used to build React applications.
// - The `Home` component is imported from the `Home.js` file.
// - The `Main` component is defined as a functional component that simply renders the `Home` component wrapped in a `div` element.
// - Finally, the `Main` component is exported as the default export of the file, which allows it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.
